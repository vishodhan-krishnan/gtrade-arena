  "full_analysis": "Tesla's stock presents a compelling bear case primarily due to its deteriorating earnings performance. The company reported a staggering 37.1% decline in earnings, which raises serious questions about its operational efficiency and future profitability. Coupled with a Price/Sales ratio of 14.96, Tesla appears significantly overvalued compared to its revenue generation, suggesting that the market may be pricing in unrealistic growth expectations. Furthermore, the company's 100% miss rate on earnings over the last four quarters indicates a troubling trend that could lead to further declines in investor confidence.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, TSLA is trading below key moving averages, which typically signals weakness in price momentum. The high Debt/Equity ratio of 17.08 poses additional risks, particularly in a rising interest rate environment, as it could strain the company's ability to service its debt. Additionally, the current market conditions, which are bullish overall, may not favor high-growth stocks like Tesla as investors become more risk-averse.\n\nThe potential for further earnings misses and increased interest rates could trigger a significant decline in TSLA's stock price, with downside targets near $182.00 based on key support levels. Given the current price of $213.21, this represents a 14.66% downside potential, while the upside is limited to approximately 10.09% before hitting resistance at $234.68. Overall, the combination of these factors leads to a high-risk assessment for Tesla, warranting a strong sell recommendation.",
