However, momentum indicators suggest the stock is nearing overbought territory, which could indicate potential for a pullback or consolidation.\n\n## Trend Assessment\n- **Primary Trend:** Uptrend\n- **Trend Strength:** Strong\n- **Moving Average Alignment:** Bullish (Price > SMA_20 > SMA_50)\n\n## Momentum Indicators\n- **RSI:** 65.8 \u2192 Slightly overbought, indicating potential for a pullback or consolidation.\n- **MACD:** 4.941 | Signal: 4.137 | Histogram: 0.804 \u2192 Bullish momentum, indicating the trend remains strong.\n- **Volume:** Normal levels, suggesting no significant divergence or distribution at this time.\n\n## Support & Resistance Levels\n- **Key Support:** $752.80\n- **Key Resistance:** $821.98\n- **Current Position:** Near resistance (3.2% away), indicating potential selling pressure could emerge.\n\n## Volatility & Risk\n- **ATR:** $17.08 (Normal volatility)\n- **Bollinger Bands:** Price is in the middle range; currently positioned at 76% of the band width, suggesting moderate volatility but potential for breakout or reversal near the upper band.\n\n## Trade Setup (If Applicable)\n**Entry:** $796.42  \n**Stop Loss:** $770.80  \n**Target:** $821.98  \n**Risk/Reward:** 1.00:1  \n\u2192 This setup presents a poor risk/reward ratio, as the potential reward does not exceed the risk taken.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: **HOLD** - Confidence: Medium  \nGiven the proximity to key resistance and slightly overbought conditions indicated by RSI and Stochastic, it may be prudent to wait for a more favorable risk/reward setup before entering a long position. The current trade setup does not meet the minimum criteria for a quality entry.\n",
