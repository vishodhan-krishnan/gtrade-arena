However, momentum indicators are showing bearish signals, suggesting a potential consolidation or pullback despite the overall upward trend.\n\n## Trend Assessment\n- **Primary Trend:** Uptrend\n- **Trend Strength:** Strong\n- **Moving Average Alignment:** Bullish (Price > SMA_20 > SMA_50)\n\n## Momentum Indicators\n- **RSI:** 51.8 (Neutral zone, indicating no immediate overbought or oversold conditions)\n- **MACD:** 14.207 (Below Signal at 16.104, indicating bearish momentum with a declining histogram)\n- **Volume:** Normal levels; no significant divergence noted, indicating that the price movement is supported by volume.\n\n## Support & Resistance Levels\n- **Key Support:** $541.45\n- **Key Resistance:** $614.42\n- **Current Position:** Near resistance (+2.3% to resistance, +10.9% to support)\n\n## Volatility & Risk\n- **ATR:** $12.69 (Normal volatility)\n- **Bollinger Bands:** Current price is positioned at a neutral middle range (63% of the way up the bands), indicating a balanced state of volatility.\n\n## Trade Setup (If Applicable)\n**Entry:** $600.61  \n**Stop Loss:** $581.58 (Risk: $19.04)  \n**Target:** $614.42 (Reward: $13.81)  \n**Risk/Reward:** 0.73:1 (Poor risk/reward ratio)\n\nRECOMMENDATION: HOLD - Confidence: Medium\n\n**Rationale:** The strong uptrend is encouraging, but the bearish momentum indicated by the MACD and the overly tight risk/reward setup suggest waiting for a clearer entry point or a more favorable risk/reward configuration. The current price is near resistance, which increases the risk of a pullback. Therefore, it may be prudent to hold off on new positions until a more favorable setup arises.\n",
