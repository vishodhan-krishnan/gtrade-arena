  "full_analysis": "As of March 17, 2025, META is experiencing a strong downtrend, with its stock price at $604.03, significantly below all key moving averages. This technical weakness is compounded by a troubling earnings report showing an 82.6% decline in earnings, raising serious questions about the company's future profitability and sustainability. Furthermore, the impending FTC trial set to commence in April poses a significant regulatory risk that could lead to operational constraints and further declines in stock price. The current market sentiment is also risk-off, with major indices in a downtrend, which could exacerbate META's stock decline.\n\nThe combination of these factors leads to a bearish outlook for META, with a downside target of $585.14, which is only 3.2% below current levels, while upside potential is limited to approximately 21.7% to resistance at $735.28. Given the high risk score of 85 and the strong conviction level based on solid data, a STRONG SELL recommendation is warranted. Investors should prepare for potential declines, particularly as the FTC trial approaches, and consider hedging strategies to protect against further losses.",
