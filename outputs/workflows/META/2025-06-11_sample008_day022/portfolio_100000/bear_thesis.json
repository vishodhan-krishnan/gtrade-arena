  "full_analysis": "As of June 11, 2025, META is showing signs of being overbought, with an RSI of 75.2 indicating potential for a pullback. The stock is trading near resistance at $707.85, with a current price of $693.14, suggesting limited upside potential. Fundamental analysis reveals a concerning -82.6% decline in earnings, raising red flags about the company's ability to sustain growth despite a 26.2% increase in revenue. The high P/E ratio of 28.39 further indicates that the stock may be overvalued, especially if earnings do not recover. Additionally, regulatory challenges from Brazil's Supreme Court, which could impose accountability on social media platforms, introduce further operational risks. These factors combined suggest a high risk of a significant price correction, with a downside target of $621.75 based on technical support levels. Therefore, a recommendation to sell is warranted, with a high conviction level supported by strong data quality.",
