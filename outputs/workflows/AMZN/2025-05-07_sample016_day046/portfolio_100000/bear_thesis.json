  "full_analysis": "As of May 7, 2025, Amazon's stock price is positioned near critical resistance levels, with a current price of $188.71 just 2.2% away from resistance at $192.88. Technical indicators suggest that the stock is slightly overbought, with an RSI of 65.0, indicating a potential pullback. The fundamental analysis reveals concerning valuation metrics, including a trailing P/E ratio of 38.46 and a Price/Book ratio of 6.60, which suggest that the stock is trading at a premium. These ratios could lead to price corrections if growth expectations are not met.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon's debt-to-equity ratio of 43.41 raises red flags regarding its financial leverage. This level of debt could pose risks, particularly if cash flows are negatively affected by rising interest rates or economic downturns. The company's current ratio of 1.05 further highlights potential liquidity issues, indicating that Amazon has just enough assets to cover its liabilities, which could lead to challenges in meeting short-term obligations.\n\nThe macroeconomic environment also presents risks, with the VIX at 23.55 indicating heightened market volatility. This uncertainty could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Amazon, particularly as the market shows signs of a potential correction. Overall, the combination of these factors leads to a strong bearish outlook for Amazon, suggesting that investors should consider reducing their positions or hedging against potential declines.",
