  "full_analysis": "As of July 3, 2025, Amazon (AMZN) is showing signs of being overbought with an RSI of 63.3, suggesting that the stock may be due for a correction. Coupled with low trading volume of 29,632,400, this indicates weak conviction behind the recent price increases, raising concerns about sustainability. The company's valuation metrics are also troubling, with a trailing P/E of 33.82 and a Price/Book ratio of 7.16, suggesting that the stock is trading at a premium that may not be justified by future growth. Furthermore, the current ratio of 1.02 raises potential liquidity concerns, particularly if market conditions shift unfavorably.\n\nThe macro environment is currently bullish, but potential triggers for downside exist, including inflation surprises that could lead to market corrections, increased competition that may erode Amazon's market share, and the risk of negative earnings reports. These factors contribute to a risk score of 75, reflecting a high level of concern regarding the stock's future performance. Given these risks, a recommendation to sell is warranted, especially as the stock approaches resistance levels with limited upside potential.",
