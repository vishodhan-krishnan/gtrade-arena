  "full_analysis": "As of August 29, 2024, Amazon's financial health is under scrutiny due to its high Debt/Equity ratio of 43.41, which raises concerns about its ability to manage financial obligations, especially in a rising interest rate environment. Additionally, the quick ratio of 0.76 indicates potential liquidity issues that could hinder operational capabilities and growth initiatives. While the company has shown impressive revenue growth of 13.4% and earnings growth of 36.4%, these metrics may not be sufficient to offset the financial risks it faces.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, AMZN's price is currently below key moving averages, suggesting bearish momentum. The mixed trend and the recent decline of 4.44% further indicate that investor sentiment may be shifting. Moreover, the broader market environment shows a risk-on sentiment, but the technology sector, where AMZN operates, is lagging, which could signal underlying weakness.\n\nGiven these factors, the downside potential for AMZN appears significant, with a target price of $151.61 based on key support levels. The limited upside is constrained by resistance at $182.39, suggesting that the risk-reward scenario is unfavorable for potential investors. Therefore, a recommendation to sell is warranted, with a high risk level due to the identified financial and market vulnerabilities.",
