  "full_analysis": "As of April 7, 2025, Amazon (AMZN) is exhibiting several bearish signals that suggest significant downside risk. The technical analysis indicates a strong downtrend, with the stock trading below all moving averages and a high P/E ratio of 35.71, which indicates that the stock may be overvalued. This is compounded by a concerning Debt/Equity ratio of 43.41, suggesting that the company is heavily leveraged, which could pose risks in an economic downturn. Furthermore, the current ratio of 1.05 raises liquidity concerns, which could affect operational flexibility in challenging times.\n\nThe macroeconomic environment is also unfavorable, characterized by a bear market where major indices have declined significantly. The S&P 500 has dropped by over 12%, indicating a broader market sentiment that is risk-off, which is likely to impact growth stocks like Amazon. With high volatility and a flight to quality, investors may prefer defensive sectors over technology, further pressuring AMZN's stock price.\n\nDownside triggers include the potential for continued market declines and rising interest rates, which could negatively impact Amazon's growth prospects. Given the current price of $175.26, there is a realistic downside target of $161.38, representing an 8.5% decline, while the upside is capped at $206.21, indicating limited potential for recovery. Overall, the combination of these factors leads to a high-risk assessment and a strong recommendation to sell Amazon shares.",
