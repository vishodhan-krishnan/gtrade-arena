  "full_analysis": "As of July 14, 2025, Amazon's stock appears to be at a critical juncture, with several bearish signals emerging from both technical and fundamental analyses. The technical indicators reveal an overbought condition, as evidenced by an RSI of 73.6, which typically suggests a pullback is on the horizon. Coupled with this, the stock is trading near its resistance level of $226.68, indicating that any upward movement is likely to be limited, while the downside potential is significant, with a key support level at $207.31.\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, Amazon's valuation metrics raise red flags. A trailing P/E ratio of 34.16 and a P/B ratio of 7.23 highlight that the stock may be overvalued compared to its earnings and book value. Additionally, the current ratio of 1.02 indicates that while Amazon can cover its short-term liabilities, it is teetering on the edge of liquidity concerns. The high debt-to-equity ratio of 43.41 further complicates the picture, suggesting that the company is heavily leveraged, which could pose risks if interest rates rise or if operational challenges arise.\n\nThe macroeconomic environment also presents potential challenges, with a strong market trend favoring small-cap stocks over large caps, indicating a shift in investor sentiment that could adversely affect Amazon's stock. As such, the risk of a market correction or sector rotation away from large-cap stocks is high, which could trigger a decline in Amazon's share price. Given these factors, the recommendation is to sell, as the combination of overvaluation, technical indicators, and macroeconomic risks presents a compelling bear case for Amazon.",
