  "full_analysis": "NVIDIA's stock is currently trading at $134.36, reflecting a strong bullish momentum. However, the technical analysis indicates an overbought condition with an RSI of 89.5, suggesting that a pullback is imminent. The stock is also near its resistance level of $136.33, which could trigger profit-taking and further declines. Fundamental analysis reveals that NVIDIA's P/E ratio of 54.36 and P/B ratio of 39.02 indicate significant overvaluation compared to industry peers, raising concerns about sustainability if growth expectations are not met.\n\nAdditionally, the company's high debt-to-equity ratio of 9.10 poses risks, especially in a rising interest rate environment, potentially impacting profitability. Recent news highlights regulatory challenges, particularly regarding U.S. export controls on AI chips to China, which the CEO termed a failure. This sentiment could lead to increased scrutiny and volatility in NVIDIA's stock price.\n\nThe combination of these factors suggests a high risk of a market correction, with a potential downside target of $102.01, representing a 24% decline from current levels. Given the limited upside potential of only 1.5% before hitting resistance, investors should consider selling NVIDIA shares to mitigate risk. Overall, the evidence points to a bearish outlook for NVIDIA in the near term.",
