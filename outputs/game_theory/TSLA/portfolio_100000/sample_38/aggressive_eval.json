  "aggression_reasoning": "While the metrics suggest avoiding TSLA, the potential catalysts for recovery and growing electric vehicle demand present an asymmetric opportunity that could yield significant upside if conditions improve.",
  "opportunity_assessment": "The market may be underestimating the potential for a rebound in earnings and the accelerating shift towards electric vehicles, which could drive TSLA's stock higher than current valuations suggest.",
  "catalyst_assessment": "The catalysts related to operational improvements and increased EV demand are compelling, particularly as consumer sentiment shifts positively in the next few quarters.",
