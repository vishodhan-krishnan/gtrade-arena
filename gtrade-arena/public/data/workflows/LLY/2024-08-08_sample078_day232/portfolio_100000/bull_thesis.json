Investors should consider entering positions in LLY, particularly on dips, as the company is well-equipped to navigate economic uncertainties and capitalize on its growth opportunities. The recommended position size of 5-10% of the portfolio reflects a balanced approach to risk management while taking advantage of LLY's strong growth potential.",
