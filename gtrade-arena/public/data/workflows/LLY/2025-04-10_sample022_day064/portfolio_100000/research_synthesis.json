    "full_analysis": "Eli Lilly (LLY) is currently experiencing significant bearish signals across multiple fronts. The stock's trailing P/E ratio of 78.82 suggests it is overvalued compared to historical averages, raising concerns about its sustainability at current price levels. Technical indicators reveal a strong downtrend, with the stock trading below all moving averages and an RSI indicating oversold conditions. This suggests that any potential bounce may be short-lived, as momentum indicators like MACD confirm bearish sentiment.\n\nMoreover, the healthcare sector is underperforming, with a recent decline of 6.95%, which could further impact LLY's stock price. The volatility in the market, highlighted by high ATR and Bollinger Bands, indicates that investors should brace for significant price swings, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the stock's future performance.\n\nDownside triggers, such as continued negative sentiment in the sector and potential earnings misses, could lead to further declines, pushing the stock closer to its key support level of $673.24. Given these factors, the risk assessment indicates a high risk score of 75, suggesting that investors may want to consider selling their positions to avoid potential losses. Overall, while there may be bullish arguments regarding growth, the evidence strongly supports a bearish outlook for Eli Lilly at this time.",
