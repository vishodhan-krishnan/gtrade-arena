  "full_analysis": "As of May 15, 2025, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is showing signs of being overbought, with an RSI of 87.4 indicating potential for a pullback. The stock is trading near its resistance level of $266.93, which raises concerns about the sustainability of its current price. Additionally, the Price/Book ratio of 2.05 and Price/Sales ratio of 5.15 suggest that the stock may be overvalued, reflecting high investor expectations that could be difficult to maintain in a fluctuating market. \n\nRecent operational challenges, such as the closure of the Capital Connect platform, further compound these risks, indicating potential weaknesses in JPM's business strategy amid broader market volatility. The current market environment, characterized by strong uptrends in major indices, could also lead to a market correction that adversely affects JPM's stock price. \n\nGiven these factors, the downside potential appears significant, with a target price around $224.16, suggesting a 15.4% decline from current levels. The recommendation is to sell, as the risks outweigh the potential for further gains, especially in light of the high valuation and overbought technical indicators.",
