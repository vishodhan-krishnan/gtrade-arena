    "full_analysis": "As of July 10, 2024, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is exhibiting significant risks that could lead to a decline in stock price. The technical analysis shows an RSI of 73.5, indicating that the stock is overbought and may be due for a pullback. Furthermore, the absence of traditional valuation metrics such as P/E ratios raises concerns about the sustainability of its current price, which is trading at a high Price/Sales ratio of 5.15. This suggests that the stock may be overvalued based on its sales performance alone.\n\nAdditionally, the company's total debt of $1.15 trillion poses a risk, especially in a changing economic environment where interest rates may rise or economic conditions may deteriorate. The potential for increased default rates on loans could negatively impact profitability, further exacerbating the risks associated with high debt levels. The market sentiment also indicates a flight to quality, with large caps outperforming, which may not bode well for JPM's future performance.\n\nIn light of these factors, the downside potential appears significant, with a realistic target price of $184.76 based on key support levels. The limited upside potential, given the current resistance at $204.16, suggests that investors face a high-risk situation. Therefore, a recommendation to sell is warranted, with a focus on protecting against downside risks through hedging strategies.",
