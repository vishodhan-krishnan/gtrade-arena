The price remains below key moving averages, indicating bearish momentum, while the RSI suggests it is slightly oversold, hinting at a possible bounce in the near future.\n\n## Trend Assessment\n- **Primary Trend:** Downtrend\n- **Trend Strength:** Strong\n- **Moving Average Alignment:** Bearish (Price < SMA_5 < EMA_10 < SMA_20 < SMA_50)\n\n## Momentum Indicators\n- **RSI:** 39.6 (Slightly oversold, potential for a bounce)\n- **MACD:** -1.894 (Below signal -1.322, indicating bearish momentum)\n- **Volume:** Above average at 7,945,800, indicating good participation but aligns with the downtrend.\n\n## Support & Resistance Levels\n- **Key Support:** $142.91\n- **Key Resistance:** $155.94\n- **Current Position:** Near support levels ($146.33 is close to $144.10 and $142.91)\n\n## Volatility & Risk\n- **ATR:** $2.92 (Low volatility, allowing for tighter stop-loss placements)\n- **Bollinger Bands:** Current price of $146.33 is near the lower band ($145.26), indicating a potential support zone.\n\n## Trade Setup (If Applicable)\n**Entry:** $146.33  \n**Stop Loss:** $150.71 (Risk: $4.39)  \n**Target:** $142.91 (Reward: $3.41)  \n**Risk/Reward:** 0.78:1 (Poor risk/reward ratio)\n\nRECOMMENDATION: SELL - Confidence: Medium\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The risk/reward ratio is less than the desired minimum of 2:1, making this a less favorable setup for a short trade.\n- Despite the oversold RSI, the overall bearish momentum with MACD and the alignment of moving averages suggests caution. A bounce may occur, but the current conditions do not present an optimal shorting opportunity.\n- Given the proximity to key support, it may be wise to wait for a clearer setup or a confirmation of a reversal before taking action.\n",
