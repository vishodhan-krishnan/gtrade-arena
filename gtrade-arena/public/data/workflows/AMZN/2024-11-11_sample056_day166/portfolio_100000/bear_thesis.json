  "full_analysis": "Amazon's current stock price of $206.84 is underpinned by a trailing P/E ratio of 144.26, which raises significant concerns about its sustainability. Such high valuations indicate that investors are pricing in substantial growth expectations that may not materialize. The company's current ratio of 1.09 suggests that while it can cover its short-term liabilities, it is precariously close to liquidity issues, particularly in a challenging economic environment. Furthermore, the debt-to-equity ratio of 43.41 indicates a reliance on leverage that could amplify risks during economic downturns.\n\nTechnical indicators reveal that Amazon is currently overbought, with an RSI of 67, suggesting that a correction could be imminent as the stock approaches resistance at $212.25. The absence of any recent bullish news or catalysts further contributes to a lack of momentum that could support the stock's price at these elevated levels. Additionally, macroeconomic factors such as rising interest rates pose a significant risk to growth stocks like Amazon, as they could dampen consumer spending and overall market sentiment.\n\nGiven these factors, the downside potential to the identified support level of $183.69 represents an 11.2% decline from the current price, while upside is limited to just 2% before hitting resistance. This risk-reward scenario is unfavorable, warranting a recommendation to sell and reassess the investment as market conditions evolve.",
