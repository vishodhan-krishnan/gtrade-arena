  "full_analysis": "As of April 29, 2025, Amazon's stock price stands at $187.39, reflecting an uptrend but also revealing significant risks. The company's P/E ratio of 38.19 suggests it is overvalued relative to its peers, and the current ratio of 1.05 raises concerns about its liquidity position. Additionally, the debt-to-equity ratio of 43.41 indicates a reliance on debt that could pose risks in a tightening economic environment.\n\nTechnical indicators also paint a concerning picture. The stock is nearing its resistance level of $198.34, and with an RSI of 61.2, it is slightly overbought, indicating a potential pullback. Low trading volume further suggests weak conviction behind the recent price movements, which could lead to volatility.\n\nGiven these factors, the potential for a market correction or deceleration in revenue growth could trigger a significant decline in AMZN's stock price. With a downside target of $161.38 based on support levels, and limited upside potential capped at 5.8%, the risk-reward scenario appears unfavorable for investors. Therefore, a strong sell recommendation is warranted, particularly in light of the high risk score of 75, reflecting the overall bearish sentiment surrounding the stock.",
