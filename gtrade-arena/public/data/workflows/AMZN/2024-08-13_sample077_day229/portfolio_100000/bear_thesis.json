  "full_analysis": "As of August 13, 2024, Amazon's stock shows significant bearish signals across technical, fundamental, and macroeconomic analyses. The technical indicators, including a bearish MACD and moving averages, suggest that the stock may continue to decline, particularly as it approaches key resistance levels. Furthermore, Amazon's high debt-to-equity ratio raises substantial concerns regarding its financial health, especially in a tightening economic environment where interest rates may rise. The quick ratio indicates potential liquidity issues, which could limit operational flexibility and growth potential.\n\nThe macroeconomic landscape is characterized by a risk-off sentiment, with small caps underperforming and defensive sectors leading the market. This suggests that investors are prioritizing safety over growth, which could negatively impact Amazon's stock price as consumer spending slows. With a current price of $170.23 and a downside target of $151.61 based on identified support, the risk-reward profile appears unfavorable.\n\nGiven these factors, the recommendation is to sell, as the combination of high debt, bearish technicals, and a challenging macro environment presents significant downside risks. The conviction in this analysis is high due to the quality and strength of the data supporting the bear case.",
