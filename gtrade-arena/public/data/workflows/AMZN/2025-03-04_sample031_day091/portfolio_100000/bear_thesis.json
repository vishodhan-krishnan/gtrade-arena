  "full_analysis": "As of March 4, 2025, Amazon's stock is in a precarious position, trading at $203.80, which is significantly below key moving averages and indicative of a strong downtrend. Technical indicators such as the RSI at 15.7 suggest oversold conditions, yet bearish momentum persists, pointing to the potential for further declines. The stock's high P/E ratio of 61.66 raises substantial concerns about overvaluation, particularly in light of the current macroeconomic environment, which is characterized by increased volatility and a risk-off sentiment among investors. The debt/equity ratio of 43.41 further complicates the outlook, as it suggests vulnerability to rising interest rates and economic headwinds.\n\nThe absence of significant news or bullish catalysts in recent weeks adds to the bearish sentiment, leaving the stock exposed to downward pressure. With key support at $197.43 and resistance at $242.52, the potential for a decline is evident, especially if revenue growth slows or earnings disappoint in upcoming reports. Given these factors, the recommendation is to strongly sell AMZN, as the risks appear to outweigh any potential rewards in the current market landscape.",
