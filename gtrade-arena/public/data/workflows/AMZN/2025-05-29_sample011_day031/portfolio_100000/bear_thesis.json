  "full_analysis": "As of May 29, 2025, Amazon (AMZN) is showing signs of overvaluation with a trailing P/E ratio of 41.92, which is significantly higher than the broader market average. This suggests that the stock is priced for high growth that may not materialize, especially in a risk-off environment where defensive sectors are outperforming. The technical indicators further support a bearish outlook, with the RSI nearing overbought levels and the MACD indicating bearish momentum. Additionally, the current ratio of 1.05 raises concerns about the company's liquidity, while a debt-to-equity ratio of 43.41 indicates substantial leverage that could become problematic in an economic downturn.\n\nThe macroeconomic landscape is also unfavorable, with major indices showing declines and a VIX indicating increased volatility. These factors contribute to a risk-off sentiment among investors, which could lead to a broader market correction, particularly affecting overvalued stocks like Amazon. With a current price of $205.70 and a key support level at $183.85, the downside potential is estimated at approximately 10.59%, while the upside is limited to around 4.4%. Given these risks and the current market conditions, a SELL recommendation is warranted, with a high conviction level based on strong data quality.",
