Despite a healthy revenue growth rate of 12.2%, the company struggles to convert this growth into profits, reflected in its modest profit margins of 4.0% and operating margins of 3.8%. The high debt-to-equity ratio of 75.73 further complicates matters, suggesting that the company is heavily leveraged, which could pose risks in a rising interest rate environment or during economic downturns.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the stock is currently overbought with an RSI of 74.3, indicating a potential pullback. The weak trading volume of 2,785,600 compared to historical averages suggests a lack of conviction in the current price levels, which could lead to volatility. Additionally, the mixed earnings quality, evidenced by a declining trend in earnings beats, could further erode investor confidence.\n\nThe current price of $541.01 is perilously close to the resistance level of $567.15, with a downside target of $468.74 based on key support. Given these factors, the stock presents a risk score of 85, indicating a high level of risk. Investors are advised to sell, as the risks are likely to materialize in the near term, particularly with upcoming earnings reports that could further reveal the company's struggles.",
