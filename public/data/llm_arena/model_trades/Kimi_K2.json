Regime is bullish and RSI is only 52.75 (plenty of headroom), but we are 1 %-point away from the 40 % single-name ceiling.

NVDA is still our largest position (~40 % of portfolio) and just bounced +2.6 % intraday while the 7-day drift is -7.8 % and RSI is only 46.7. The 40 % rule caps us, so we cannot add more even though the intraday bounce looks encouraging.\n\n2. UNH is our best performer (+16.6 % P&L, 3.3 % weight). RSI is 76.8 and it is 11.8 % above its 20-day SMA \u2013 statistically extended. A tactical trim makes sense to lock in alpha.\n\n3. TSLA has rallied 9.8 % above its 20-day SMA and RSI is 73 \u2013 also extended. Position is only 2.2 % of book, but we can harvest some beta.\n\n4. On the weak side, AMZN and LLY are down ~8 % on the week with RSI below 35. They are washed-out but not yet showing reversal candles; we have no exposure so we can wait.\n\n5. We have plenty of cash (~37 %). After trimming the extended names we can selectively re-deploy into beaten-down large-caps that still have fundamental support. GOOGL (RSI 37.9, -6 % on the week) and MSFT (RSI 40.8, -4 % on the week) both fit. Because we are already long GOOGL and slightly underweight MSFT vs benchmark, we add to MSFT.\n\nRisk-control: every trade >$500, no name will exceed 40 % after rebalancing.\n\nPlan:  \n- Sell $5 k of UNH (reduce overweight).  \n- Sell $3 k of TSLA (harvest beta, still keep a toe-hold).  \n- Buy $5 k of MSFT (add to high-quality large-cap that has pulled back and has bullish 12-month seasonals into earnings).  \nNet cash change is -$3 k, leaving us ~36 % cash \u2013 plenty of flexibility for tomorrow.",

We leave the rest of the tech exposure untouched \u2013 valuations are resetting but fundamentals have not changed, so we want to retain beta for a snap-back rather than wholesale liquidation.  \n\nNo new buys today; cash raised goes to 4% and gives optionality if we see wash-out levels (VIX >25).",

Defensives (KO, JNJ, PG, UNH) keep pushing higher on low volume and are now extremely over-bought (RSI > 72).  \nRisk/Reward: with SPY \u20131.4% vs its 20-d and QQQ \u20134.2%, chasing the defensive rally is low-expected-value; instead we want to harvest strength and add to the most washed-out names that still have structural tail-winds.\n\nPortfolio reality check:\n- NVDA is already 27.7% of NAV and is still sliding (-7.8% w/w).  Adding here would push us over the 40% single-name limit and concentrates risk in a name that has lost technical support.  \n- UNH, KO, PG are tiny legacy positions that have become very stretched; trimming them realises tax-free gains and raises cash to redeploy into the oversold tech complex.  \n- GOOGL and META both have RSI < 30 and are trading at ~21\u00d7 FY25 EPS vs 28-30\u00d7 for the market \u2013 they are the best risk-adjusted way to play a reflex rally without adding single-name concentration beyond NVDA.  \n- AAPL is only a 0.01-share odd-lot; closing it simplifies the book.\n\nAction plan:\n1. Trim UNH (0.38 sh \u2192 0) \u2013 small dollar value, extreme RSI, realise +17% gain.  \n2. Trim KO \u2013 no position yet, but we will not initiate; instead we will raise cash by selling the over-bought defensives we already own (PG 12.45 sh).  \n3. Sell entire PG position \u2013 RSI 63.7, +2.5% gain, frees ~$2,050.  \n4. Close residual AAPL position \u2013 $2 position, housekeeping.  \n5. Add to GOOGL \u2013 RSI 25.7, 7-day \u20134.6%, strong FCF, no index-flow overhang this week.  \n6. Add to META \u2013 similar oversold read-through, Reels & AI monetisation runway intact.  \n7.

NVDA is washed-out (\u201310.5 % week, \u20137 % vs SMA20) and the stock bounces fastest once sentiment turns.  \n2. GOOGL and MSFT are also very oversold (RSI 26 and 27) but GOOGL shows the weakest 7-day relative action.  \n3. Adding a defensive consumer-staple like PG (RSI 54, +6 % week) would lower beta.\n\nRisk:\n- Bear-normal regime means rallies tend to be sold; chasing today\u2019s +5 % move in LLY could leave us caught in a reversal.  \n- We already have 55 k cash (23 % of NAV) \u2013 plenty of dry powder, so no need to become fully invested.\n\nDecision:\nTrim the best performer to lock in alpha and recycle the money into the most beaten-up high-conviction name while keeping overall gross exposure roughly unchanged.  \n\u2192 Sell 20 % of the META position (\u2248 $8 000) and buy NVDA with the proceeds. This keeps META as our #1 position (~13 %) while averaging down in NVDA without breaching the 40 % single-name rule.",

The laggards are diversified staples/energy: GS \u20134.5%, XOM \u20136.4%, CVX \u20135.3%. Portfolio beta is high, cash only 12.7%, and we are still \u20131.25% vs. SPY \u20130.05% over the same horizon \u2013 we need to reduce drawdown volatility while keeping upside.\n\nOpportunities:\n1. NVDA printed an 8.2% candle on no news \u2013 classic short-covering/AI-beta chase. RSI only 40, so not over-bought; add on momentum with tight risk control.  \n2. GOOGL is washed-out (RSI 25, \u20137.4% in 7d) and statistically cheap vs. large-cap tech; a mean-reversion rally into low-150s looks probable.  \n3. TSLA is firm (6.6% 7-day gain, above 20-day SMA) and only a 5% weight \u2013 can add safely.\n\nRisks:\n- V still >78 RSI and WMT >85 \u2013 crowded defensives; trimming makes sense.  \n- Energy complex is in a tactical downtrend (XOM, CVX below 20-day with falling RSI) and macro headwinds (oil curve soft) suggest further weakness; cut exposure.  \n- Mega-cap concentration already >60%; adding more tech requires trimming elsewhere to stay within 40% single-name rule.\n\nRationale for trades:\n1. Add $5k NVDA \u2013 keeps us riding the AI beta but keeps weight <30% (still below 40% cap).  \n2. Initiate $5k GOOGL \u2013 contrarian mean-reversion, low basis.  \n3. Reduce $4k XOM \u2013 material under-performer, no near-term catalyst, frees cash.  \n4. Reduce $3k CVX \u2013 same energy thesis.  \n5. Trim $2k V \u2013 extreme RSI, limited alpha.  \nNet cash change ~+$1k, keeping dry powder; all trades >$500 rule satisfied.",

      "model_reasoning": "Sentiment: The tape is in a low-volatility bull regime (VIX 16.6) and every major index (SPY, QQQ) is printing 7-day gains. Breadth is healthy: 13 of the 20 tracked names are above their 20-day SMA and only four (CVX, GS, JPM, XOM) show sub-35 RSI levels that could be interpreted as oversold rather than bearish. Momentum leaders this week are NVDA (+12.2%), AMZN (+7.6%), MSFT (+5.3%) and TSLA (+5.0%). Mega-caps are clearly still the path of least resistance.\n\nPortfolio review: We are already 77% invested, with NVDA at 32.5% of capital \u2013 very close to the 40% per-name ceiling. The position is highly profitable (+2.5% in one day, +12% in a week) and the regime supports letting winners run, but we cannot add another full-sized purchase without breaching the limit. META and LLY are also performing well and do not require action. The only material laggard is XOM (-5.2% vs cost) but its RSI < 38 and today's flat print suggest downside exhaustion; no need to dump into weakness.\n\nOpportunities: V and WMT flash RSI > 80, i.e. technically overbought; chasing here offers poor risk/reward. JPM is beaten-up (-6.8% on the week, RSI 32) but financials are still under distribution and we already own GS; adding more banks would double-down on a lagging sector. Therefore the best risk-adjusted add is a modest NVDA top-up and/or broadening slightly into the strongest weekly performers that are not yet at extreme RSI.\n\nRisk control: Because NVDA is already 32.5% of the book we can only buy ~7.5% more before hitting the 40% cap; we will size the new trade so that pro-forma exposure stays just below the limit (\u224838%). Cash would fall to roughly $18k, still enough for two subsequent $500-min trades.\n\nRationale for trade: Add a tactical $5k to NVDA while the price is consolidating near the highs with momentum intact; this keeps us <40% rule, adds delta to our best winner, and avoids over-paying for overbought names. No sells are required today\u2014every other position is either too small (AAPL ",

Cash $17.8k (7%) \u2013 plenty of dry powder.\n\nPlan:\n- Sell the 0.01 AAPL position (trivial, but cleans the book).  \n- Trim 20% of GS and 20% of XOM (\u2248$1.9k + $0.3k = $2.2k freed).  \n- Add $5k to NVDA (keeps us just under 40% cap).  \n- Add $3k to META (momentum, still <20% weight).  \n- Add $2k to MSFT (trending, RSI not extreme yet).  \nNet result: cash neutral, raise exposure to strongest trends, cut micro-positions and laggards.",

A pullback is statistically likely; trimming rather than adding is prudent.\n4. META is similarly stretched (RSI 81, +5.9% vs SMA-20) and only 2.9% weight. We can afford to add a bit without breaching the cap, but risk/reward is poor here.\n5. Weak names with bearish RSI and negative short-term drift: MSFT (RSI 35, \u20132.8% vs SMA-20), AMZN (RSI 44, \u20132.4%), PG (RSI 32, \u20132.6%), KO (RSI 30, \u20132.7%), V (RSI 34, \u20131.9%).

However, position is only 3% of book and the ticker historically mean-reverts violently; cutting now risks missing a snap-back.

Because we are already at the 40% ceiling we cannot legally add; we must either hold or trim.

We are already 36.5% NVDA \u2013 only ~$10k of head-room before the 40% ceiling. Any NVDA add therefore needs to stay under that.\n\nOpportunity vs risk:\nNVDA still has upward momentum into earnings season and AI spending data-points are constructive. Adding a small $5k slug keeps us under the 40% cap and raises our basis only marginally.  \nConversely AAPL is a 0.5% position that is not moving the P&L needle; trimming it releases $3k cash and simplifies the book.\n\nNo other names offer a better risk-adjusted add right now (TSLA too big, MSFT overbought, financials heavy, defensives breaking down). Stay long the strongest liquid megacap (NVDA) and fund it with the micro-sized AAPL stub.",

Current weight 11.7% \u2013 still under the 40% cap and the technical tape is supportive; modest add keeps us in the strongest trend.  \n- AMZN and TSLA both showing weekly strength; AMZN 6.2% W-o-W, TSLA 5.8% above 20-d but \u20136.6% on the week \u2013 mixed signal, hold.  \n- AAPL is \u20133% vs entry and \u20133% vs 20-d; weight is negligible (0.01 sh = $2).

Portfolio structure  \n- NVDA is already the largest position (24.6% of NAV) and sits just above its 20-day SMA with RSI 57 \u2013 not extreme, but adding more would push us well above the 40% single-name limit.  \n- We are ~2.9% cash; raising a little cash from laggards leaves room to add higher-beta winners on any dip.\n\n3. Individual set-ups  \n- AAPL: only 0.00% weight; 1-share remnant. No downside to flattening.  \n- KO: oversold, but 7-day slide intact and consumer staples are out-of-favour; trim rather than add.  \n- LLY: broken momentum, RSI sub-30 but still making lower highs; better to reduce and re-deploy.  \n- JNJ: same oversold profile as KO \u2013 cut for liquidity.  \n- TSLA: up 24% in a week, today \u20135.8% on high volume; chasing here is poor risk/reward.  \n- V: RSI 84 \u2013 extended; no fresh entry.  \n- GS, CVX, AMZN: strong but RSI >70; prefer to hold rather than chase.  \n- NVDA: core winner, but already overweight; instead of buying more we\u2019ll hold and raise cash via weak names.\n\n4. Risk & opportunity  \n- Raising ~$11k cash gives flexibility to buy any tech/NVDA dip next week while staying within concentration rules.  \n- Keep secular winners (META, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, JPM, QQQ) that are not yet overbought.",

Breadth is healthy\u2014QQQ, SPY, MSFT, TSLA, META printing new highs or near them.\n\nPortfolio snapshot: You are already 94% invested, only 5.6% cash, and +11.24% YTD. The big winners (META, AMZN, GS, WMT) are up double-digits and pushing portfolio weights above 3% each, but none breach the 40% single-name cap. The two laggards with the weakest weekly momentum are NVDA (-4.98% 7-day) and GOOGL (-2.55% 7-day). However, NVDA\u2019s 1-day reversal (+0.27%) and RSI < 45 make it a textbook mean-reversion candidate inside an up-trend (BULL_NORMAL). GOOGL is similarly oversold with RSI 37.9 and -1.21% vs SMA20, but its weight is already 17%\u2014above most other names\u2014so adding is less attractive.\n\nRisk checks: AAPL\u2019s RSI is 83.4 and WMT\u2019s is 82.1\u2014both flashing short-term overbought. Your AAPL position is microscopic (0.01 sh = $2.38) and acts like cash; trimming is pointless, but you can\u2019t buy more until it cools. WMT is only 1.8% of book, so no action needed.\n\nOpportunity: NVDA\u2019s 7-day pullback into the low 130s has been orderly, volume is light, and it bounced Friday. With BULL_NORMAL regime and low VIX, odds favor a snap-back toward the 20-day SMA (~$142) which is >2% upside from here. Using the last ~$5.7k of available cash to add ~41 shares keeps weight under 25% and adds beta to the portfolio\u2019s largest thematic driver (AI).\n\nNo sells are mandatory\u2014no position is extremely overbought or oversized\u2014but keeping a small cash buffer is prudent. Because the only real \u201ccash-like\u201d position is the 1-cent AAPL stub, we will leave it rather than create a $500 min-trade violation.\n\nBottom line: Add to beaten-down NVDA for a tactical bounce while staying within risk rules; otherwise hold the winners and let them run.",

      "model_reasoning": "1. Sentiment \u2013 Macro backdrop is BULL_NORMAL with VIX at a subdued 13.45. 7-day breadth is solid: 14 of the 20 names are positive, led by growth/momentum (AMZN +10.7%, LLY +10.9%, META +9.8%, WMT +4.4%, TSLA +1.5%). Only CVX, JNJ, JPM, KO, PG, V and XOM are red on the week, and most of those declines are <2%. No sign of risk-off.\n\n2. Portfolio check \u2013 We\u2019re already 87% invested, so fresh cash is limited ($12k). Largest concentration is NVDA at 27.4% of NAV; that is close to the 40% single-stock ceiling, but still within rule limits. Every core position is profitable and above its 20-day SMA except XOM (-4.2%) and KO (-1.2%). Risk-adjusted trailing stops are not yet triggered.\n\n3. Opportunities \u2013 \n   - NVDA printed the strongest 1-day move (+3.5%) on rising volume, RSI only 48 (plenty of head-room) and the AI narrative into year-end remains intact. Adding a tactical $5k keeps us below the 30% gross weight while riding momentum.\n   - AAPL is up 5.7% this week and tagged an RSI of 85 \u2013 statistically stretched vs its own history. Trim $3k to lock in quick gains and free cash for better risk/reward elsewhere.\n\n4. Risks \u2013 Single stock limit (40%) is the binding constraint; adding to NVDA keeps us compliant. A sudden VIX spike toward 20+ would warrant a broader defensive trim, but current option pricing shows little concern. Energy (CVX, XOM) is softening with oil, but weights are modest (combined 6.5%) and we\u2019ll hold for now.\n\n5. Rationale \u2013 Re-allocate within the portfolio: harvest an overbought AAPL slice, recycle into NVDA which is breaking out yet still not overbought. Net cash used \u2248 $2k, leaving ~$10k buffer for tomorrow\u2019s opportunities without breaching sizing rules.",

Relative-strength ranking (7-day momentum vs. 20-day SMA):  \n   - Leaders: NVDA +6.0%, UNH +2.5%, JPM +1.5%, LLY +1.9%  \n   - Laggards: CVX \u20115.8%, UNH \u20115.8%, META \u20113.4%, MSFT \u20113.0%, AMZN \u20112.5%  \n\n2. RSI extremes:  \n   - AAPL 76.8 \u2192 technically overbought  \n   - XOM 9.6, CVX 18.9 \u2192 deeply oversold  \n   - PG 29.5, UNH 32.1, LLY 37.4 \u2192 low but not yet washed-out  \n\n3. Portfolio concentration: NVDA is already 31.6% of assets \u2013 very close to the 40% ceiling. Any new purchase risks breaching the rule, so we either trim first or add only a token amount.\n\n4. Cash is only $2.3k; every buy has to be funded by a corresponding sale to stay above the $500 minimum trade size.\n\nOpportunities:  \n- CVX/XOM look capitulated and often mean-revert in this regime; a small oversold bounce is probable.  \n- AAPL has run 12.6% in portfolio and 3.2% in a week with RSI >75 \u2013 prudent to harvest some.  \n- NVDA still shows relative strength and is the portfolio\u2019s alpha engine, but we can\u2019t add size without first reducing the position back below ~30%.\n\nRisks:  \n- Broad market is drifting sideways; adding large new exposure on either side could hurt Sharpe.  \n- Selling AAPL keeps us well inside the 40% single-name cap and raises cash for higher-conviction oversold plays.\n\nPlan:  \n1. Sell $5k AAPL (\u224819.4 shares) \u2013 locks in >12% gain, drops weight to effectively nil, and funds new trades.  \n2. Trim NVDA by $7k (\u224850 shares) \u2013 brings weight from 31.6% down to ~28%, freeing firepower and obeying risk rule.  \n3. Deploy $4k into CVX (4.6\u00d7 normal oversold, dividend support) and $3k into XOM (RSI 9.6 \u2013 even more washed-out) for a paired energy mean-reversion.  \n4. Remainder of raised cash ($5k) sits ready for future tech dips or to re-add NVDA on any >5% pullback.",

Sentiment & regime  \n- VIX 15.95 is calm, all tickers in BULL_NORMAL \u2192 no systemic risk, but rotational pull-back inside the trend.  \n- Yesterday was a broad 1-2% down-day; 7-day drift is slightly negative for most mega-caps, so sentiment is \u201chealthy consolidation\u201d.\n\n2. Position check vs. rules  \n- Largest holding NVDA is 29% of NAV \u2192 still 11% head-room before the 40% single-name cap.  \n- Several names are <1% weight (AAPL 0.01 shr, KO 0.12 shr, GS 2.31 shr, V 7.85 shr, WMT 11.32 shr) \u2013 they are statistical noise and can be either trimmed or rounded-up to a sensible size.\n\n3. Technical set-ups  \n- NVDA: 7-day +5%, RSI 42 (plenty of room), only -0.6% P&L in book \u2192 buying the shallow intra-day dip looks attractive and keeps us in the strongest AI theme.  \n- TSLA: -4.95% today, -10% on the week, RSI still 59 but price 4.5% above 20-SMA \u2192 high vol, no edge; hold for now.  \n- CVX & XOM: energy complex drifting, RSI 22.8 & 10.8 respectively \u2192 deeply oversold, but seasonally weak into year-end; no rush to add.  \n- AAPL: 0.01 sh is not economic; either sell or buy enough to make a position \u2013 given it\u2019s +11% vs. cost and RSI 69, I\u2019ll take the profit and recycle cash.  \n- GOOGL: second biggest holding (16.6%), strong momentum (+13.9% P&L) \u2013 no action.  \n- QQQ: liquid beta, 9.3% weight \u2013 hold.  \n- Small positions with decent uptrend (V, WMT) \u2192 round up to ~1% each to make them meaningful.\n\n4. Cash usage  \nAvailable cash $2,268 + proceeds from AAPL sale \u2248 $5.7k \u2192 total ~$8k to deploy.  \n- Add ~$5k to NVDA (keeps weight <40%)  \n- Add ~$1k each to V and WMT to bring them to ~1% of NAV  \nLeaves ~$1k buffer for settlement noise.\n\nRisks: single-day move against us on NVDA could swing NAV ~1.2%, but that is acceptable inside the 40% limit.

Risk Check \u2013 Concentration & Cash  \n   - NVDA is already 32 % of NAV, only 8 %-pts away from the 40 % ceiling. Adding more would breach the rule on the first up-tick.  \n   - Cash is $0; any new purchase has to be funded by an existing sale.  \n\n3. Weak Hands to Trim  \n   - KO (0.04 % weight) is down \u20115.1 % with RSI 32.7; dead money.  \n   - AAPL has a 0.00 % weight; the 0.01-share is a bookkeeping stub \u2013 can be sold without moving the needle.  \n   - JNJ stub (0.00 % weight) is likewise meaningless.  \n\n4. Strong Hands to Hold / Add  \n   - CVX is breaking out (+7 % week, RSI 75) and only 7.7 % position; trimming here is premature.  \n   - LLY (2.3 %) and UNH (6.2 %) show relative strength and can be added if we free up cash.  \n\n5. Action Plan  \n   - Raise cash by liquidating the micro-positions in KO, AAPL and JNJ; no meaningful P&L impact but gives ~$11-12.  \n   - Use the proceeds to top-up the winners: CVX (energy tail-wind) and LLY (defensive growth).  \n   - Keep NVDA size unchanged \u2013 already the largest exposure and very close to limit.  \n   - Resulting portfolio stays fully invested, respects the 40 %-cap, and tilts toward names that are actually working in the current bear-normal tape.",

UNH: weekly +2.8%, RSI 66, above 20-day; defensive growth with political overhang fading. Under-weight at 0.8%.\n3. CVX/XOM: energy up 5-6% on week, oil stabilised; add to winner.\n4. AAPL: RSI 21.6, -9% on week, -12.5% P&L \u2013 risk of catching a falling knife but trimming a 0.2% position frees cash for higher-conviction bets.\n\nRisks: TSLA breaking down -16% vs 20-day; META, GOOGL still below key support; any macro shock spikes VIX >25 and forces de-risking.\n\nRationale: Keep gross exposure high (cash already >20%) but rotate from laggard AAPL into momentum-energy and under-weight defensives. NVDA add keeps beta while UNH/CVX add defensives with upward momentum.",

Most names are still below their 20-day SMAs, but today\u2019s broad bounce (+1.5-5%) is encouraging and RSI levels are mostly in the 40-50 zone (not oversold, not overbought).\n\nPortfolio snapshot: 18 positions, total value $234k, cash ~1.2%. No single ticker >12% weight, so concentration risk is low. Overall draw-down \u20116.24% vs SPY \u201110.8% since our entry, so we\u2019ve outperformed by ~4.5%.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Momentum divergence: the biggest daily winners today (TSLA +5.4%, NVDA +3.9%, META +4%, AMZN +4.3%) are exactly the names that got hit hardest over the last 7 days. RSI for these four is still <45 \u2013 plenty of room before over-bought. Short-covering + dip-buying is under way; odds favor at least a multi-day relief move.\n2. Relative strength leaders: LLY 7-day +13%, WMT +6.3%, KO & JPM steady. These are acting defensive/growth-defensive and still trending above their 20-day.\n3. Laggards that keep lagging: UNH is \u201128% in a week on Medicare-rate fears; chart looks broken and RSI 33 but no sign of basing. CVX is \u20117% vs SMA20 and oil volatility remains high. Both are below 30-day lows and risk of further under-performance is high.\n\nRisk control: we are already ~99% invested. Raising cash slightly lets us stay nimble and lock-in recent out-performance.

Trim NVDA by ~$20k (keeps it at ~12% \u2013 still a top-3 bet but frees cash and obeys 40% rule).  \n2. Sell entire LLY ($17.3k) \u2013 stop-loss discipline; redeploy into oversold PG and into XOM which is bouncing with firming crude.  \n3. Cut QQQ by $10k (still a 11% weight) and add that to defensive consumer (KO) and to JPM which is flagging after a strong week but remains best-in-breed financial.  \n4. Small add to AAPL \u2013 it is down 5% on the week, RSI 46, and offers a low-risk re-entry with $190-200 range-bound support.  \n\nNet result: raise cash buffer to ~3%, reduce single-name tech beta, increase low-beta yield names, keep upside via NVDA/META/MSFT at lower concentration.",

We are effectively \u201cmax long\u201d the single best momentum name and have no room to add without first trimming. All other large weights (JPM 10.5%, QQQ 7.8%, V 5.9%, LLY 5.4%) are <40%, so only NVDA is a constraint.\n\nKey signals:\n1. NVDA: RSI 75.17, +8% vs SMA20, 7-day run +5.85%. Price action is parabolic; trimming 1/3 of the position locks in >20% gain and brings weight from 40% to ~27%, freeing capital for other set-ups while keeping a large core long.\n2. TSLA: 7-day +11.4%, RSI only 52.6 (room to run), daily breakout +3.2%. No position currently; adding a 3% weight captures the rebound without chasing extremes.\n3. META: RSI 33.8, 7-day \u20133.9% under-performance; sentiment washed out inside a bull regime. Small starter position (2.5% NAV) for mean-reversion once selling dries up.\n4. UNH: deeply oversold (RSI 33.7, \u20136.7% week), but lacks positive catalyst and relative strength; avoid for now.\n5. Defensives (KO, PG, WMT, XOM) all rolling over vs SMA20; we already hold small positions and will let them drift rather than add.\n\nCash freed by NVDA trim \u2248 $28k (sell 223 sh @ $172.39). Allocate 5k TSLA + 5k META leaves ~18k cash buffer; portfolio stays liquid for future opportunities.\n\nRisk management: After trades, largest single stock (NVDA) drops to ~27%, still the top conviction but no longer at regulatory limit.",

Current dollar weight \u2248 $76.5k; we can add \u2248 $39k more without breaching rule.  Momentum is intact: +2.25% today, +4.1% this week, RSI 73 (elevated but not extreme in a trending market).

Rather than open a fresh position we prefer to concentrate capital into higher-conviction names that we already own.\n\nNo stop-loss signals are flashing: every position is above cost and the weakest holdings (KO, JNJ, WMT, XOM, UNH) are down only marginally vs cost and remain within normal pull-backs.  Therefore no trims are required for risk control today.\n\nCash is ample ($46k) so we can fund the NVDA purchase without touching other positions.

      "model_reasoning": "The market is in a BULL_NORMAL regime with low VIX (15.48), indicating relatively low fear and continued upward momentum. Risk appetite is healthy.\n\n1. **NVDA** is the portfolio\u2019s largest position (24.7%) and just hit a new high with strong 1-day (+2.14%) and 7-day (+4.60%) performance. RSI is 73.87 \u2014 elevated but not yet extreme. Momentum remains intact and the name is a clear leader. I want to add, but not so much that I breach the 40% single-name ceiling. Adding ~$5k keeps us under the cap and adds alpha.\n\n2. **AAPL** has lagged (1-day \u20131.05%, 7-day \u20131.61%) and RSI is sub-40, showing relative weakness. It\u2019s only 0% of the portfolio because we don\u2019t currently hold it, but if we did we would trim. Since we don\u2019t hold it, we can\u2019t sell \u2014 but we can use the slot for better alpha. (No action on AAPL this turn.)\n\n3. **GOOGL** RSI is 92.3 \u2014 extremely overbought. However, trend is strong and we have only a 5.3% weight. Rather than trim today, we\u2019ll watch for a momentum breakdown; for now let winners run.\n\n4. **UNH** looks washed-out (RSI 29.6, \u20138.5% vs SMA20) but fundamentals remain intact; a bounce is likely. We already have a 2.6% weight \u2014 hold.\n\n5. **META** and **TSLA** are showing mild weakness but weights are small (1.7% and 0.6%). No need to trim.\n\nCash is ~15.6% of the portfolio; putting some to work in the strongest name (NVDA) while keeping liquidity for future opportunities is optimal.",

RSI extremes are limited (WMT 81, UNH 23) and most mega-caps are printing 60-70 RSI, i.e. healthy up-momentum rather than euphoric. Breadth is improving: GOOGL, NVDA, META, MSFT all > +3% with volume confirmation. The only real 7-day laggards are AMZN (-8.9%), UNH (-13.5%) and AAPL (-4.9%).\n\nOpportunities:\n1. NVDA is breaking the recent $175 resistance with 63 RSI and 5% gap vs 20-dma; incremental weight raises the largest winner without breaching the 40% single-name cap (currently 27%).\n2. GOOGL and META are exhibiting relative strength; adding a modest amount to GOOGL keeps us in the fastest re-accelerating large-cap name while RSI < 75.\n3. UNH is washed-out (< 25 RSI) and bouncing intraday; a starter position is a contrarian mean-reversion with defined risk.\n\nRisks:\n- Bear-normal regime still caps size; VIX can spike back > 20 quickly.\n- AAPL is under-performing and may retest $195; trim 5% of the position (\u2248 $3k) to free cash for higher-beta tech.\n- Energy (CVX, XOM) is slipping again; maintain small weights.\n\nRationale:\nRaise NVDA to ~30% weight \u2013 still below the 40% ceiling \u2013 to ride the strongest trend while momentum is intact.

Position is already 31.8% of NAV\u2014within the 40% rule but leaves little room to add without breaching risk limits.\n- AAPL is +4.31% today and +11.32% on the week; RSI 74.16 is the highest in the portfolio and 8.6% above its 20-day SMA.

Reduce AAPL by ~$3k (\u224812 shares) to lock in part of the 11% weekly sprint while RSI > 70.\n2.

Positioning Check  \n- NVDA is already 39.6% of the book\u2014only 0.4% headroom to the 40% rule. Cannot add.  \n- LLY is 14.7% and extended (+10.5% vs SMA20, RSI 71), but momentum is strong and biotech seasonality is favorable into year-end; trim rather than exit.  \n- META is the only outright loser (-4.4% P&L, -6.6% 7-day, RSI 27.9) but oversold enough for a relief bounce; maintain size.  \n- AAPL is 0% owned, RSI 79.6\u2014extreme overbought; chasing here is poor risk/reward.  \n- Cash is only 4.1%\u2014low for a portfolio up 27% YTD; raising liquidity makes sense.\n\n3. Actionable Trades  \na) Take partial profits on the two most extended winners inside the portfolio:  \n   - LLY: sell $7 k (~8 shares) \u2192 brings weight to ~12% and locks in 23% gain.  \n   - JNJ: sell $3 k (~16 shares) \u2192 RSI 74, 6.8% weekly pop; weight drops to ~1.8%.  \n\nb) Use proceeds plus a sliver of existing cash to start a new position in UNH (health-care defensive with momentum: +1.8% today, +2.4% week, RSI 60.7, vs SMA20 +4.5%). Healthcare political noise is low into election winter and UNH seasonally works in Q4.\n\nNet effect: raise cash to ~7%, keep core tech tilt (NVDA capped), reduce concentration risk, add defensive momentum name.",

Sector rotation into defensives is evident: WMT (+6.16% 7-day, RSI 75), JNJ (RSI 94), UNH, KO, LLY all holding up while growth/momentum (NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GS, META) has faded.  \n2.

High-conviction winners with overstretched RSI need trimming: WMT (RSI 75), JNJ (RSI 94), LLY (RSI 76).

Adding more would breach the rule, so any new buy must be \u2264 the amount that keeps us \u226440%.\n- META is 3.3% but deeply red; cutting it frees up capital for stronger names.\n- AAPL is only 0.6% weight; trimming a token amount is pointless \u2013 better to either build or hold.\n\nRisk management:\n- Keep NVDA at max allowable exposure (it\u2019s the alpha-driver).\n- Rotate out of weakest relative strength (META, UNH, WMT) into high-momentum names that still have technical head-room (AMZN, NVDA, TSLA, LLY).\n\nCash is $10.9k \u2192 we can deploy more, but we must respect the 40% single-stock cap.\n\nCalculations:\n- Current NVDA position value = 648.07 sh \u00d7 $202.48 \u2248 $131 250.\n- 40% of total NAV ($331k) = $132.4k \u2192 head-room \u2248 $1.15k only.\n- Therefore no sizeable NVDA buy possible without breaching limit; instead we top-up other strong names.\n\nAction plan:\n1.
