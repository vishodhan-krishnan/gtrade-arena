The RSI values for most stocks are above 50, suggesting a bullish trend. However, some stocks like NVDA, MSFT, and LLY have high RSI values (above 70), which may indicate overbought conditions. On the other hand, stocks like XOM, JPM, and KO have relatively low RSI values, which could make them attractive for buying. The 7-day price changes show that some stocks like AAPL, NVDA, and TSLA have gained significantly, while others like AMZN, JPM, and UNH have been relatively flat. Considering these factors, I will look for buying opportunities in stocks with strong momentum but relatively low RSI values. NVDA, despite its high RSI, has shown strong momentum and could be a good buy. Since I'm starting from a 100% cash position, I will initiate a buy trade in NVDA. I won't sell any stocks at this point since I don't have any positions.",

On the other hand, stocks like XOM and CVX are showing weakness, which could indicate potential risks or areas to avoid.\n\nOur rationale is to diversify our portfolio by taking advantage of the bullish momentum in certain stocks while being cautious of potential downturns in others.

However, some stocks are showing strong momentum, such as NVDA, which has a 1D return of +3.08% and a relatively low RSI of 44.7. This suggests that NVDA may have room for further growth. On the other hand, META has a 1D return of -1.73% and a 7D return of -7.42%, indicating a potential downturn. Our portfolio has a significant allocation to NVDA, which has been performing well, but we may consider taking profits or adjusting our position size to manage risk. We also notice that XOM has a very low RSI of 6.28, which may indicate overselling and a potential buying opportunity. However, given the current market regime and the stock's recent poor performance, we will exercise caution.

NVDA, with an RSI of 43.67, is a promising candidate for a long position. On the other hand, stocks like TSLA, LLY, and WMT have experienced significant losses and may be due for a bounce. However, their high volatility and bearish trend make them risky investments.\n\nRisks are present in the form of a potential market downturn, with the BEAR_NORMAL regime and high VIX value indicating a high level of uncertainty. Stocks like GOOGL, GS, and JPM have experienced significant losses and may continue to decline. \n\nThe rationale behind the trade decisions is to capitalize on the momentum of strong stocks while minimizing exposure to risky investments. Buying NVDA and potentially other stocks with strong momentum can help to increase the portfolio's value.

Its RSI is 43.4, which is not overbought, and its price is below its SMA20, indicating a potential buying opportunity. \n\nOn the other hand, AAPL has a 1D return of +0.44% and a 7D return of +4.77%, which is a relatively stable performance. However, considering our portfolio's current allocation and the fact that AAPL is not one of our holdings, there's no need to take any action on this stock.\n\nOur current holdings, such as GS and JPM, have relatively low RSI values, indicating that they might be due for a bounce. However, their recent performance has been lackluster, with GS having a 1D return of +0.83% and a 7D return of -2.59%, and JPM having a 1D return of +0.15% and a 7D return of -2.50%. \n\nGiven these considerations, we will choose to buy more NVDA to capitalize on its momentum and hold our current positions in other stocks. We will also not make any sales at this time, as our holdings are generally performing well.",
