  "full_analysis": "Eli Lilly's stock is currently trading at an exceptionally high P/E ratio of 143.84, which raises significant concerns about the sustainability of its growth. The Price/Book ratio of 54.53 further confirms that investors are pricing in aggressive growth expectations that may not be achievable, especially given the recent trend of declining earnings surprises. The company also has a high debt-to-equity ratio of 178.52, which indicates a reliance on leverage that could pose risks in a rising interest rate environment.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the stock is showing bearish momentum, with the MACD below the signal line and a neutral RSI suggesting a lack of strong momentum in either direction. The current price of $864.63 is precariously positioned between key support at $836.70 and resistance at $930.30, indicating limited upside potential of about 7.5% compared to a downside risk of approximately 3.6%.\n\nIn the broader macroeconomic context, the market is in a RISK-OFF environment with major indices experiencing a downtrend, which could further exacerbate the stock's volatility. The combination of these factors leads to a bearish outlook, with a strong recommendation to sell, as the risks associated with holding the stock outweigh the potential rewards.",
