    "full_analysis": "Goldman Sachs (GS) is currently trading at $473.26, facing significant bearish signals that suggest a potential decline. The technical analysis indicates a bearish momentum with the MACD showing negative divergence and low trading volume, which signals weak conviction in the current price level. Additionally, the stock is nearing a critical resistance level of $503.94, while key support is significantly lower at $426.10, suggesting a risk of a sharp decline if market conditions worsen.\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, GS is burdened by a high debt-to-equity ratio of 586.14 and a negative enterprise value, which raises red flags about its financial health. Despite a strong earnings history with a 100% beat rate, the sustainability of these earnings is questionable given the company's financial leverage. The overall macroeconomic environment is also unfavorable, with major indices like the S&P 500 and NASDAQ showing downtrends, indicating a broader risk-off sentiment in the market.\n\nGiven these factors, the downside potential is estimated at 10% towards the support level of $426.10, while the upside is limited to 6.5% at the resistance level. The overall risk score of 75 reflects the high risks associated with holding this stock. Therefore, a strong sell recommendation is warranted, with suggested hedging strategies to protect against potential declines in the near term.",
