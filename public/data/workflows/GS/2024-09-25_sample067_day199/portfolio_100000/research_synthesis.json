    "full_analysis": "Goldman Sachs (GS) is currently facing significant risks that could lead to a decline in its stock price. The company's high debt-to-equity ratio of 586.14 raises concerns about its financial stability, especially in a rising interest rate environment. Additionally, the negative enterprise value of -$4.49 billion suggests that the market may be undervaluing the company's assets relative to its liabilities, which could deter potential investors. Technical indicators are mixed, with the stock trading near key resistance levels and showing weak bullish momentum, which indicates that any upward movement may be limited.\n\nMoreover, the overall market sentiment is neutral, with no strong bullish signals detected in recent analyses. This lack of momentum, combined with the potential for a market correction in the coming months, poses a significant downside risk for GS. The current price of $481.32 is only 6.9% above the identified support level of $448.33, suggesting that the stock could easily fall to this level if bearish sentiment prevails.\n\nIn light of these factors, the recommendation is to sell GS shares, as the risks appear to outweigh potential rewards. Investors should consider hedging strategies, such as purchasing put options, to protect against further declines. The time horizon for these risks to materialize is estimated at 3-6 months, coinciding with potential market corrections.",
