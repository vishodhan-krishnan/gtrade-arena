  "override_reasoning": "The expected value of +1.09% does not meet the threshold of 2.0% for a buy recommendation, indicating that the potential upside does not justify taking a position. Additionally, the risk/reward ratio of 0.00:1 suggests that there is no potential for reward without a downside, which is unacceptable.",

  },
  "ev_interpretation": "The +1.09% expected value is insufficient to justify a position because it falls significantly short of the 2.0% threshold, indicating limited potential upside relative to the risks involved.",
  "rr_interpretation": "A risk/reward ratio of 0.00:1 is not acceptable, as it implies there is no potential upside without a corresponding downside, making the investment highly speculative.",
