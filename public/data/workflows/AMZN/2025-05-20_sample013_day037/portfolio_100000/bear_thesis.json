  "full_analysis": "As of May 20, 2025, Amazon's stock price of $204.07 reflects significant overvaluation, with a trailing P/E ratio of 41.59 and a Price/Book ratio of 7.13. These metrics suggest that the stock is priced for perfection, leaving little room for error. The current ratio of 1.05 raises concerns about liquidity, particularly if the company faces unexpected operational challenges or economic downturns. Additionally, the Debt/Equity ratio of 43.41 indicates a high level of leverage, which could become problematic in a rising interest rate environment, as borrowing costs increase and investor sentiment shifts away from highly leveraged firms.\n\nTechnical indicators further support the bear case, with the RSI at 71.1 indicating overbought conditions, suggesting a potential pullback is imminent. The stock is currently trading near resistance levels, with limited upside potential of only 5.3% to $214.84, while downside risks could lead to a decline towards the key support level of $178.85, representing a potential drop of 12.36%. Given these factors, the recommendation is to sell, as the risks of a significant correction appear substantial in the current market environment.",
