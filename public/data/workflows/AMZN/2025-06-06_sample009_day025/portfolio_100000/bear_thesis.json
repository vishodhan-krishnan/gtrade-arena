  "full_analysis": "As of June 6, 2025, Amazon (AMZN) is exhibiting signs of being overvalued, with a trailing P/E ratio of 43.52 and a P/B ratio of 7.46, suggesting that the stock is trading at a significant premium compared to historical averages. This high valuation raises concerns about the sustainability of its current price, especially given the company's debt-to-equity ratio of 43.41, which indicates a heavy reliance on debt financing. Such leverage poses risks in an environment where interest rates may rise, potentially increasing the cost of servicing that debt and impacting profitability.\n\nAdditionally, technical indicators point to overbought conditions, with the RSI at 64.2 and the stock price nearing resistance at $214.84. This suggests that a pullback could be imminent, particularly if broader market conditions shift or if Amazon fails to meet growth expectations in upcoming earnings reports. The current price of $213.57 is precariously close to this resistance, limiting potential upside while exposing investors to significant downside risk.\n\nIn light of these factors, the overall sentiment is bearish, with a strong recommendation to sell. The combination of high valuation, overbought technical indicators, and elevated debt levels creates a precarious situation for Amazon's stock, warranting caution among investors and suggesting that a correction could be on the horizon.",
