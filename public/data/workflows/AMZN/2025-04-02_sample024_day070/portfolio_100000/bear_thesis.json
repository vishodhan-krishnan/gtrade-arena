  "full_analysis": "As of April 2, 2025, Amazon (AMZN) is trading at $196.01, reflecting a 4.72% decline over the past week, indicating potential weakness in investor sentiment. The technical analysis reveals a sideways trend with weak momentum, as the stock is currently below its 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages. This technical weakness, combined with a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 52.4, suggests that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but the overall bearish trend raises concerns about future performance.\n\nFundamentally, Amazon's high P/E ratio of 39.94 and P/B ratio of 6.85 indicate that the stock is trading at a significant premium compared to historical averages, suggesting overvaluation. Furthermore, the current ratio of 1.05 raises liquidity concerns, as it indicates that the company has just enough short-term assets to cover its liabilities. The high debt-to-equity ratio of 43.41 poses additional risks, especially in a rising interest rate environment where debt servicing costs could increase.\n\nThe macroeconomic environment is also unfavorable, with major indices experiencing downtrends and increased volatility, as indicated by the VIX at 21.51. This risk-off sentiment could lead to further declines in equity prices, particularly for high-valuation stocks like Amazon. Given these factors, the potential for a market correction, combined with economic headwinds, suggests that AMZN could face significant downside risk in the coming months.",
