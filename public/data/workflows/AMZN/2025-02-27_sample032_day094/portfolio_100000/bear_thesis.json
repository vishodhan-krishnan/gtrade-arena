  "full_analysis": "As of February 27, 2025, Amazon (AMZN) is showing strong bearish signals across technical, fundamental, and macroeconomic analyses. Technically, the stock is in a pronounced downtrend, with key indicators such as the RSI at 16.0 indicating oversold conditions, yet the overall momentum remains bearish. The current price of $208.74 is precariously close to the key support level of $204.16, suggesting limited upside potential with a resistance level at $242.52. Fundamentally, Amazon's high P/E ratio of 63.16 raises serious concerns about overvaluation, especially in the context of a bear market where growth expectations may not be met. Additionally, the debt-to-equity ratio of 43.41 indicates a higher leverage level, which could pose risks in a rising interest rate environment.\n\nThe macroeconomic backdrop is also unfavorable, with major indices in significant downtrends and increased volatility indicated by a VIX of 21.13. This risk-off sentiment suggests that investors are wary, particularly in sectors like technology and consumer discretionary, where Amazon operates. The absence of recent news or catalysts further contributes to a stagnant sentiment around the stock, reinforcing the bearish outlook.\n\nGiven these factors, the recommendation is a strong sell, as the risks of a continued decline are high, and the potential for recovery appears limited. Investors should consider hedging strategies to mitigate potential losses as market conditions evolve in the coming months.",
