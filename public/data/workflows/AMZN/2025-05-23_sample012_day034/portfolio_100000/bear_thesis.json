  "full_analysis": "As of May 23, 2025, Amazon (AMZN) is exhibiting several bearish signals that suggest significant downside risk. The stock is currently trading at $200.99, which is near key resistance levels of $214.84, indicating limited upside potential. The high P/E ratio of 40.96 and P/B ratio of 7.02 reflect a premium valuation that may not be sustainable, especially considering the elevated Debt/Equity ratio of 43.41, which raises concerns about financial stability in a potentially tightening economic environment.\n\nTechnical indicators further support the bear case, with the RSI at 66.6 indicating overbought conditions and a likelihood of a pullback. The market's current risk-off sentiment, as evidenced by a high VIX of 22.29, adds to the uncertainty surrounding AMZN's stock performance. Additionally, rising interest rates, with the 10-Year Treasury yield at 4.51%, could negatively impact growth stocks, making AMZN particularly vulnerable.\n\nTriggers for a potential decline include a market correction driven by rising rates, negative earnings surprises, or increased competition in the e-commerce and cloud sectors. Given these factors, the downside target is set at $178.85, representing a 10.93% decline from the current price, while the upside is limited to approximately 6.88% based on resistance levels. Overall, the combination of overvaluation, high leverage, and market volatility leads to a high-risk assessment for AMZN, warranting a sell recommendation.",
