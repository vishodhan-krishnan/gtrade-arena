  "full_analysis": "As of May 15, 2025, Amazon (AMZN) is exhibiting signs of potential overvaluation and financial risk. The trailing P/E ratio of 41.81 indicates that the stock is trading at a premium, with investors expecting continued high growth rates. However, if these growth rates falter, the stock could face significant downward pressure. Additionally, the company's debt/equity ratio of 43.41 raises concerns about its financial health, especially in an environment where interest rates are likely to rise. This could lead to increased borrowing costs and tighter margins.\n\nMoreover, the technical analysis reveals that AMZN is currently in an overbought condition, with an RSI of 66.8, suggesting that a price pullback may be imminent. The current price is also near resistance at $214.84, limiting potential upside to just 4.7%. In contrast, the downside risk to key support levels at $165.29 represents a significant 19.5% decline.\n\nThe lack of recent news coverage further complicates the outlook, as it suggests a period of stability that could quickly turn volatile with any negative developments. Without significant bullish catalysts, the absence of news may indicate investor indifference, which is often a precursor to declines in stock prices. Given these factors, the recommendation is to sell AMZN shares, as the risk of a downturn appears substantial in the current market environment.",
