  "full_analysis": "As of June 11, 2025, Amazon (AMZN) presents a compelling bear case driven by several key risk factors. The stock's trailing P/E ratio of 43.45 indicates a significant overvaluation relative to traditional benchmarks, raising concerns about its sustainability in a potential market correction. Coupled with an RSI of 69.5, which signals overbought conditions, there is a strong likelihood of a price pullback. Furthermore, the company's current ratio of 1.05 suggests only marginal liquidity, which could pose risks if cash flow becomes constrained in an economic downturn.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon's debt/equity ratio of 43.41 highlights a reliance on leverage that could become problematic if interest rates rise. This elevated debt level increases the company's vulnerability to macroeconomic shifts, particularly in the face of inflationary pressures from rising oil prices, which may impact consumer spending.\n\nGiven these factors, the downside potential is significant, with a target price of $197.85 based on key support levels, representing a 7% decline from the current price of $213.20. The limited upside is constrained by resistance at $218.40, suggesting that the risk/reward profile is unfavorable for investors considering new positions. Therefore, a recommendation to sell is warranted as the stock faces multiple headwinds that could trigger a decline in the near term.",
