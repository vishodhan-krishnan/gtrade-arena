  "full_analysis": "As of August 26, 2024, Amazon (AMZN) is showing signs of being overbought, with an RSI of 75.9 indicating potential for a price pullback. The technical analysis highlights a bearish trend with the current price at $175.50, which is near resistance levels. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 43.41 raises significant concerns about its financial stability, especially in an environment where interest rates may rise. Additionally, the quick ratio of 0.76 suggests liquidity issues that could hinder the company's ability to meet short-term obligations.\n\nThe macroeconomic environment is also a critical factor to consider. While the market is currently bullish, the potential for economic downturns and interest rate hikes poses a risk to high-debt companies like Amazon. The absence of recent bullish news or catalysts further underscores the lack of momentum that could support the stock price in the near term.\n\nGiven these factors, the downside potential for Amazon appears significant, with a realistic target of $151.61 based on identified support levels. The risk assessment indicates a high overall risk score of 75, reflecting the combination of high debt levels, liquidity concerns, and overbought technical indicators. Therefore, a recommendation to sell is warranted, with a focus on hedging strategies to protect against further declines.",
