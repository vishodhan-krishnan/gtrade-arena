  "full_analysis": "As of March 17, 2025, Amazon's stock is positioned in a precarious situation marked by a strong downtrend and bearish momentum indicators. The technical analysis reveals that the stock is trading below all major moving averages, with an RSI of 34 indicating oversold conditions but with little bullish momentum to suggest a recovery. Furthermore, the proximity to key support at $190.85 suggests limited downside potential, yet the overall sentiment remains negative.\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, Amazon's trailing P/E ratio of 59.22 and P/B ratio of 7.32 indicate that the stock is significantly overvalued relative to its earnings and book value. This raises concerns about the company's ability to meet high growth expectations, particularly in a macroeconomic environment that is increasingly bearish. The high Debt/Equity ratio of 43.41 further complicates the outlook, as rising interest rates could impact the company's financial stability and growth potential.\n\nThe macroeconomic backdrop is not favorable, with major indices in a strong downtrend and a risk-off sentiment prevailing among investors. The rising interest rates pose a significant headwind for growth stocks like Amazon, which rely on cheap capital for expansion. The combination of these factors leads to a high risk score of 75, indicating that investors should proceed with caution.\n\nIn conclusion, while Amazon has demonstrated strong operational performance, its high valuation, deteriorating technical indicators, and a challenging macroeconomic environment create substantial downside risks. Therefore, a recommendation to sell is warranted, with a focus on potential earnings misses or continued interest rate hikes as key triggers for further declines.",
