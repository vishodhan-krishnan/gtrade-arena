  "full_analysis": "As of March 28, 2025, Amazon (AMZN) is exhibiting a strong downtrend, with its price significantly below key moving averages and positioned near critical support levels. The technical indicators suggest a bearish outlook, with a lack of clear bullish signals to support a price recovery. Coupled with a high P/E ratio of 58.31 and a P/B ratio of 7.20, Amazon's stock appears overvalued, raising concerns about its ability to sustain current price levels amidst slowing growth expectations.\n\nMoreover, the company's current ratio of 1.06 indicates potential liquidity issues, which could further exacerbate risks if market conditions deteriorate. The macroeconomic environment is also unfavorable, with rising interest rates posing a challenge to growth stocks like Amazon. The mixed performance of major indices, particularly the decline in the NASDAQ, reflects a broader market sentiment that could negatively impact Amazon's stock price.\n\nGiven these factors, the downside potential appears significant, especially if the company fails to meet growth expectations in upcoming earnings reports. With the current price at $192.72 and a downside target of $189.38, the risk-reward profile does not favor investment in Amazon at this time. Therefore, a sell recommendation is warranted, with a high risk level due to the combination of valuation concerns, technical indicators, and macroeconomic headwinds.",
