  "full_analysis": "As of April 10, 2025, Amazon (AMZN) is exhibiting a bearish trend characterized by a price below key moving averages and a high P/E ratio of 36.93, indicating potential overvaluation. The current ratio of 1.05 raises liquidity concerns, suggesting that Amazon may struggle to cover short-term liabilities effectively. Coupled with a strong bear market, where major indices are experiencing significant declines, the overall market sentiment is risk-off, further pressuring AMZN's stock price. \n\nThe absence of positive news or catalysts in the recent week also contributes to a lack of investor confidence, leaving the stock vulnerable to broader market movements. Technical analysis indicates key support at $161.38, which presents a downside target should the bearish trend continue. \n\nMoreover, rising interest rates at 4.39% could hinder growth prospects for Amazon, as higher borrowing costs may impact both consumer spending and the company's operational costs. If operational costs increase or competitive pressures mount, Amazon's profit margins could be significantly affected, leading to a potential negative earnings surprise in upcoming reports. \n\nIn conclusion, the combination of high valuation metrics, liquidity issues, and a bearish macroeconomic backdrop presents substantial downside risk for Amazon, warranting a strong sell recommendation.",
