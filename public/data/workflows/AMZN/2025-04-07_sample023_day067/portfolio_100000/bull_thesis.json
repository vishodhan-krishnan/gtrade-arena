  "full_analysis": "As of April 7, 2025, Amazon's stock price is facing downward pressure, but the underlying fundamentals present a compelling case for a bullish outlook. The company has demonstrated robust earnings growth of 36.4% and revenue growth of 13.4%, indicating efficient scaling and operational strength. Additionally, Amazon has consistently outperformed earnings expectations, achieving a 100% beat rate over the last four quarters, which suggests strong operational performance and could lead to positive analyst sentiment and stock price appreciation.\n\nWhile technical indicators show a current downtrend and bearish sentiment, the RSI at 36.5 indicates that the stock may be oversold, presenting a potential for a short-term bounce. Moreover, the company's high return on equity (ROE) of 24.3% reflects effective management and could attract more investors looking for quality growth stocks.\n\nThe risk-reward profile appears favorable, with a potential upside target of $206.21 based on resistance levels, offering a reward-risk ratio of 2.22 against a downside support of $161.38. Although there are concerns regarding valuation and leverage, the strong free cash flow and growth metrics suggest that Amazon is well-positioned to navigate market volatility. Thus, a buy recommendation is appropriate, with a suggested position size of 5-10% of the portfolio and a 3-6 month holding period to capitalize on potential recovery.",
