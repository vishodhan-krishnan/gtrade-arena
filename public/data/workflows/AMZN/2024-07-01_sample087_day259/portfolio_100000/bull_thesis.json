Technically, AMZN is in a strong uptrend, currently trading at $197.20, which is above all major moving averages, signaling bullish momentum.\n\nLooking ahead, key catalysts such as the upcoming earnings report and continued expansion in e-commerce and cloud services could drive further interest in the stock.
