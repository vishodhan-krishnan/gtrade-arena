  "override_reasoning": "The expected value of +0.18% does not meet the threshold of 2.0% for a buy recommendation, indicating insufficient upside potential. Additionally, the risk/reward ratio of 0.00:1 suggests there is no potential downside risk, which is unrealistic given the current market conditions and high debt levels.",

  "ev_interpretation": "+0.18% EV is not enough to justify a position as it falls well below the minimum threshold for a buy, indicating limited potential for profit.",

  "reasoning": "Given the current metrics and the high level of risk associated with GOOGL, it is prudent to avoid taking a position. The expected value and risk/reward ratio do not support a favorable investment case.",
  "vs_research_manager": "While the research manager recommends a sell based on high confidence in bearish indicators, my assessment focuses on the insufficient expected value and risk/reward metrics, leading to a more cautious stance of avoidance rather than outright selling.",
