  "override_reasoning": "The expected value of +1.27% does not meet the threshold of 2.0% for a buy recommendation. Additionally, the risk/reward ratio of 1.30:1 is below the preferred level of 1.5:1, indicating that the potential reward does not sufficiently outweigh the risks involved.",

  "ev_interpretation": "+1.27% EV is not enough to justify a position as it falls short of the 2.0% threshold, indicating limited upside potential.",
  "rr_interpretation": "1.30:1 R/R is not acceptable as it suggests that the downside risk is greater than the potential upside, which is not favorable for investment.",

  "reasoning": "Given the current metrics and the cautious stance from the research manager, it is prudent to hold off on any new positions. The existing risks and the lack of a strong expected value suggest that capital should be preserved until more favorable conditions arise.",
  "vs_research_manager": "While the research manager recommends a sell based on bearish sentiment, my view is to hold due to the potential for a small upside, albeit with caution due to existing risks.",
