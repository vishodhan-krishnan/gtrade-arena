  "full_analysis": "As of July 14, 2025, Tesla's stock is under significant pressure from multiple fronts. The technical analysis indicates a bearish momentum, with the MACD showing negative signals and the stock trading below its key moving averages, suggesting a weak trend. The fundamental analysis reveals that TSLA's P/E ratio of 173.69 is alarmingly high, indicating that the stock is overvalued relative to its earnings. Coupled with a troubling decline in earnings growth of -37.1%, this raises serious questions about the company's profitability and future performance.\n\nMoreover, Tesla's earnings quality is concerning, as evidenced by a 0% beat rate over the last four quarters, which reflects a lack of confidence from analysts and investors alike. The macroeconomic environment is also shifting, with rising Treasury yields that could further pressure growth stocks like Tesla. The absence of any recent positive news or catalysts only adds to the uncertainty surrounding the stock.\n\nGiven these factors, the downside potential appears significant, with a target price of $288.77 representing an 8.5% decline from the current price of $316.90. In contrast, the upside is capped at 12.8% to the resistance level of $357.54, creating a risk-reward scenario that heavily favors the bears. Therefore, a strong sell recommendation is warranted, with high conviction based on the robust data supporting the bear case.",
