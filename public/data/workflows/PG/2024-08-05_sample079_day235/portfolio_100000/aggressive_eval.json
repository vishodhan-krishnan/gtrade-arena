  "aggression_reasoning": "The R/R of 1.50:1 indicates a favorable risk profile, and the positive asymmetry score suggests potential upside that may be underestimated by the market. I believe the current conditions could lead to a stronger performance than anticipated.",

  "reasoning": "Given the favorable R/R and the potential for upside, I see an opportunity to capitalize on PG's stability in a volatile market. The lack of catalysts is a concern, but the risk-reward profile justifies a moderate position.",
