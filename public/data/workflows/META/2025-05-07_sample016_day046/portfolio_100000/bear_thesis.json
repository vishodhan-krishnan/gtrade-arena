  "full_analysis": "As of May 7, 2025, META is exhibiting significant bearish signals that warrant caution for investors. The technical analysis reveals an overbought situation, with an RSI of 78.7 suggesting that the stock is due for a pullback. Coupled with this, the company has reported a staggering earnings decline of -82.6%, which raises serious concerns regarding its operational efficiency and ability to convert revenue growth into profit. The current P/E ratio of 24.41 and P/B ratio of 7.01 indicate that the stock is trading at a premium, which may limit its upside potential if earnings do not recover.\n\nFurthermore, recent news highlights internal acknowledgment from executives about the competitive threat posed by TikTok, which could further impact user engagement and advertising revenue. This recognition of competitive pressure adds to the bearish sentiment surrounding the stock. With the current price positioned near resistance at $603.47 and a key support level at $479.11, the potential for a significant downside exists, estimated at approximately 19.6%.\n\nIn light of these factors, the recommendation is to sell META shares, as the risks appear to outweigh the potential rewards. Investors should also consider hedging strategies to protect against downside risk, particularly as the upcoming earnings report may reveal further operational challenges.",
